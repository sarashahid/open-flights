* **Week of 11/15** 
- A class for the graph was constructed on the airportGraph.h file. It was called airportTree. The structures airportNode and airportEdge were defined and given constructors. 

* **Week of 11/22** 
- Started working on BFS
- The function for the calculating Haversine distance was constructed along with a helper function.
- Acquired the OpenFlights data, and created functions for reading the files and adding their contents to the AirportGraph, AirportEdge, and Airport Node classes.
- AirportGraph, Edge, and Node classes were restructured from the original file structures, and modified so that the AirportGraph constructor also read in the OpenFlights data.
- OpenFlights data was sampled & shortened to run preliminary tests on.

* **Week of 11/29** 
- Finished BFS, and started working on Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Completed the testing suite for BFS, Dijkstra’s algorithm, and Betweenness Centrality.

* **Week of 12/6** 
- Standardized and connected all of the classes and functions together. Created the getShortestPaths function for use in conjunction with Dijkstra’s algorithm. Created the main file to get user input and use it to run the code. 
- OpenFlights data modified to remove outlying data points, and tests ran on full dataset

*Note: this Development Log was originally created on Google Docs instead of within our project files
