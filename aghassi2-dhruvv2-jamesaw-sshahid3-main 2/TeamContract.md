3. **Respect** Group members will be asked for their opinions during the weekly meetings, and the group Discord will always be receptive to comments/concerns.

# Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** During the weekly meetings the group will discuss their strengths/weaknesses and work will be assigned based on what fits everyone best. If unexpected work appears then that the group member should inform the others and a meeting to discuss the new work may be called. 
2. **Time Commitment** The group members should expect to spend no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours on the project weekly. In the weekly meetings, any prior commitments should be brought up beforehand so work can be distributed evenly. If the commitments become too out of hand then it will be brought up to the course staff.
